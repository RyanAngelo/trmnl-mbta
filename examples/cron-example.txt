# Example cron job for TRMNL MBTA Schedule Display
# Add to crontab with: crontab -e

# Run every 30 seconds (requires special cron syntax or multiple entries)
# Note: Most cron implementations don't support seconds, so you might need to use a different approach

# Alternative: Run every minute and let the CLI handle the 30-second interval
# This runs the CLI continuously, which will update every 30 seconds internally
* * * * * cd /path/to/trmnl-mbta && /path/to/trmnl-mbta/.venv/bin/python cli.py --once

# Or run every 5 minutes (if you want less frequent updates)
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/trmnl-mbta && /path/to/trmnl-mbta/.venv/bin/python cli.py --once

# For continuous operation with 30-second intervals, use systemd service instead
